# APP Containerization Workshop - Microsoft Technology Centers

The Azure app containerization tool is a new feature rolled out from [Azure Migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview), which helps containerize applications and run them in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The tool works by using the running state of the applications on an application server to determine the application components and help package them in a container image. The tool itself doesn't require access to the codebase and provides an easy way to containerize existing application.

At this point, the tool is applicable to the following types of applications:

- ASP.NET apps (to Windows containers on AKS)
- Java Web Apps on Tomcat (to Linux containers on AKS)

## About the workshop 

The workshop provides the audiences with the hand-on experience on the app containerization tool, including installation, configuration, migration and monitoring. It provides the best practices and detailed guidance for each of the topics, all without customization or code. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) may be required. 

This workshop can either be self-led or as part of a MTC-led workshop where MTC technical architect will discuss and deliver the content while being available for taking the questions. A sample agenda is listed in the following section. 

**Audience**: IT executives, IT - system developers, IT - system operations and administrations
